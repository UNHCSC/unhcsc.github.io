# About the UNH Cybersecurity Club

The **University of New Hampshire Cybersecurity Club** is a student-driven organization focused on providing hands-on experience in the rapidly growing field of cybersecurity. Our club is divided into two main groups: the **General Club** and the **Competition Team**. Whether you are interested in learning the fundamentals or competing at the highest level, we offer opportunities for everyone to grow their skills and pursue their cybersecurity goals.

## Our Mission  
Our mission is to:
- Provide practical, hands-on experience through a combination of virtual and bare-metal resources for cybersecurity projects.
- Develop and maintain a collaborative environment that encourages learning, innovation, and problem-solving.
- Compete in cybersecurity competitions, including the prestigious **Northeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NECCDC)**.
- Equip students with the technical skills and professional development needed to succeed in the cybersecurity industry.

## Our Infrastructure  
Our club boasts a comprehensive **cybersecurity lab**, comprised mainly of **Dell servers** and **Mikrotik switches** to support both virtual and bare-metal environments. These resources are used for a wide variety of cybersecurity tasks, including network simulations, vulnerability testing, and security research. The infrastructure provides students with the tools to engage in real-world scenarios and develop the technical skills needed to tackle modern cybersecurity challenges.

In addition to our standard lab setup, we are developing an **in-house King of the Hill environment**, integrated with **Proxmox**, that simulates a competitive, real-world network defense scenario. This dynamic environment will serve as both a training ground for our competition team and a resource for general club members interested in sharpening their practical cybersecurity skills.

## Our Groups  
- **General Club**: Open to all students, this group focuses on hands-on learning, workshops, and networking. We provide access to our lab resources and host regular training sessions on various cybersecurity topics.
- **Competition Team**: This is a specialized group of students who train and compete in national and regional cybersecurity competitions. The team participates in events such as the **NECCDC** and **Capture the Flag (CTF)** competitions, which test members' abilities to defend and attack real-world networks.

## Competitions & Events  
We actively participate in high-stakes cybersecurity competitions, especially the **NECCDC**. These events provide an opportunity for our competition team to demonstrate their skills under pressure in a simulated real-world environment. Members also have access to various workshops, talks, and networking events to help build technical skills and connect with industry professionals.

## Join Us  
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned cybersecurity enthusiast, the **UNH Cybersecurity Club** offers something for everyone. Our community is driven by collaboration, learning, and mutual support.

I am pleased to announce that we will be releasing an open source "King of the Hill" environment runner. This will be a mostly automated system allowing for the creation of environments of many "teams" with their own containers. These containers are LXC Ubuntu containers being run on the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE). These containers are all purposefully flawed, and vulnerable in many ways.

blah blah blah add more once this is done
